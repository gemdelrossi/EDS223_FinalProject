# EDS223_FinalProject

This is the README file for the EDS 223 Final Project.   
  
The data structure for your folders should go as follows:  
 ``` 
EDS223-final_project
│   README.md
│   Rmd/Proj files   
└───data
    └───clean_data
    |   |   aggregated_data
    │   raw_data
    │   sample_clean_data  
    └───zambia_geoboundaries
    |   │   adm1
    |   │   adm2
```
The code chunk provided within the RMD file should create this structure for you, but check to make sure all your directories are set up properly.  
  
The raw_data and sample_clean_data folders should be empty, and the clean_data folder will contain the .nc precipitation files for the years 2015-2020 you will need.   
  
The zambia_geoboundaries include shape files of Zambia at the administrative 1 and administrative 2 unit level and can be found here: https://www.geoboundaries.org/countryDownloads.html but are also included in this repo
